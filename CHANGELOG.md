### Changed
* Major overhaul of namespacing to aid in categorization of icons.
...* Naming now follows the pattern of **x--y-z**, where:
......* x = icon-name
......* y = modifier (usually a container variation or visual modification of a dynamic icon)
......* z = denotes that the modifying container is outlined

* Updated existing rounded icon style to squared. This will allow for quicker development of new icons while increasing the crispness of edges in certain icons
