  * `upgrade`

  * `x--circle-o`

### Changed
- Major overhaul of namespacing to aid in categorization of icons. Naming now follows the pattern of `x--y-z`, where
  * `x` = icon-name
  * `--y` = modifier (usually a container variation or visual modification of a dynamic icon)
  * `-z` = denotes that the icon, or modifying container, is outlined

- Updated existing(all) icon styling from rounded to squared. This will allow for quicker development of new icons while increasing the crispness of edges in certain icons

- Icons from `0.2.0` renamed or aliased to a new icon in `1.0.0`
  * `inbound-trunk` aliased to `phone-inbound`
  * `outbound-trunk` aliased to `phone-outbound`
  * `seats` aliased to `user`

### Deprecated
- Namespacing that uses the 'icon' prefix is now considered deprecated. Old icon class names from `0.2.0` are mapped to the correct corresponding icons in this update(`1.0.0`). For new/current namespacing, see the [**Changed**] section above.

### Removed
- Icons removed
  * `account-settings`
  * `configuration`
  * `international-call`
  * `international-number`
  * `loading-circle`

## [0.1.0] thru [0.5.0] - `2015-2017`

**This changelog begins with the notes(directly above) on Telicon 1.0.0. The initial implementation and updates to Telicon went undocumented and are being considered as foundational.**
