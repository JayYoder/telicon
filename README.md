## Project Progress

* Icons will be kept within the [`icons/svg/...`](https://github.com/joshsanders/telicon/tree/master/icons/svg) directory in the repo.
* Each icon will have a production-ready version (`[icon-name].svg`) available in the repo.

The following tools are currently used to design and produce icons:

* Adobe Illustrator (any svg editor will do)
* SVGO for optimization
* IcoMoon
